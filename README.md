# Google CodeU Spring 2019

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://sp19-codeu-5-328.appspot.com)

During 10 weeks, we collaborate virtually to develop a web app that was personally meaningful for us.  Along the way we were coached by a Google engineer as our team creates design documents, conducts code reviews and navigates complex technical challenges.

We also had the opportunity to better understand how to navigate the Computer Science space - professionally and academically.  The CodeU community is a long-lasting source of support for folks who are ready to challenge the status quo. The goal is to give us access to broad skills, deep knowledge and a robust network of peers and Googlers so that you can more readily carve your path within tech.

### Outcome:
# Coding Pool

#### What is Coding Pool?
CodingPool is designed to cater to anyone looking to sharpen their interview skills. CodingPool makes it easy to keep track of problems you have solved, leave follow up comments or questions on other users' posts to help the community get a better understanding or clarify questions.

Each swimmer has the questions they have posted appear on their own personal feed, as well as statistics showing what type of questions you have solved and how many of the total questions posted you have solved.

#### Why Coding Pool?
We know it is hard to prepare for those tough interview questions. We too are college students trying to figure out how to succeed with tough problems in a stressful environment. The best way to get ready for that environment is to practice! The other swimmers in the pool are going through the same struggles as you, and they want to help you succeed as well. Which is why we have all questions tagged with their specific topic, so if there is something in particular you want to work on, the other swimmers have made it easy to find.
