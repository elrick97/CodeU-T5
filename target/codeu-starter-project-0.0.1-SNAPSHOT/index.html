        <p class="lead">Welcome to CodingPool! This is a place where you can practice and post computer science related interview questions. You can share your own example coding interview problems and challenge the community, or look through questions posted by others and challenge yourself!.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <h2>What is CodingPool?</h2>
        <p>CodingPool is designed to cater to anyone looking to sharpen their interview skills. CodingPool makes it easy to keep track of problems you have solved, leave follow up comments or questions on other users' posts to help the community get a better understanding or clarify questions. </p>
        <p>Each swimmer has the questions they have posted appear on their own personal feed, as well as statistics showing what type of questions you have solved and how many of the total questions posted you have solved.</p>
        <h2>Why CodingPool?</h2>
        <p>We know it is hard to prepare for those tough interview questions. We too are college students trying to figure out how to succeed with tough problems in a stressful environment. The best way to get ready for that environment is to practice! The other swimmers in the pool are going through the same struggles as you, and they want to help you succeed as well. Which is why we have all questions tagged with their specific topic, so if there is something in particular you want to work on, the other swimmers have made it easy to find.</p>
        <h2>The Best Practice Is...Practice!</h2>
        <p>Quite simply, the best way to be fully prepared on your interviews is to practice solving problems in an interview style. Try writing your code in a blank word processor document, by hand, or on a white board to try and get a feel for what coding is like during a professional interview. And the best way to practice questions you may be asked in an interview is to work on similar problems other people in your shoes have seen and tried themselves.</p>
        <h2>Don't Be Intimidated!</h2>
        <p>Of course, not all swimmers are created equal. Of course a freshman will have a different level of coding skills than a PhD candidate...and that's ok! Though it may be intimidating for that freshman to see higher level questions, we encourage questions of all skill levels to be posted, and we encourage challenging yourself to questions that may seems too advanced for you. Get stuck on one of those problems? Don't be afraid to leave questions for other swimmers to help with under the problem you are stuck on. Since we are all going through the same process, do not be embarrassed to reach out. So whether you want to hang around the shallow end and get your toes wet, or do a belly flop into the deep end, get to swimming!</p>
